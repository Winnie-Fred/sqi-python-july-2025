I was supposed to call Chika yesterday, but I forgot to dial 0803 456 7890. This morning, Uche also sent me a reminder through WhatsApp to reach out to the new supplier at 0706 112 3344. Meanwhile, Ada dropped her contact card with 0812 987 6543, just in case we needed urgent deliveries. Finally, my cousin Emeka texted me from 0905 223 8899, asking if Iâ€™d be around this weekend.
